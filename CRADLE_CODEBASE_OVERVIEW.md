## Cradle Codebase Overview
The pre V1 cradle codebase contains the following main modules:
1. Cradle Contracts
    - Contain barebones implementations of contracts
2. Cradle Contract Integrator
    - A wrapper around cradle contracts to provide a rust sdk for interacting with the cradle protocol for our backend
3. Cradle Backend
    - Db schemas for the cradle backend as well as api exposure for interacting with the cradle contracts through the cradle contract integrator
4. Cradle Client
    - This is a TypeScript API client library for the Cradle Back-End REST API
5. Cradle Frontend
    - Cradle web-based trading platform for both retail and institutional investors to trade tokenised assets as well collateralize their assets.
